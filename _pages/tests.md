# Strategy and Workflow

Due to the amount of data that LKFT produces, test results need to be clear and
actionable. This means there is a very low tolerance for any tests which
sometimes pass and sometimes fail. Further, any test that is expected to fail
is marked as a known issue in [qa-reports](https://qa-reports.linaro.org/lkft/)
so that results are always in a 'all green' state. This makes triaging new
regressions straightforward.

Whenever a test becomes a known issue, a bug is opened in
[bugzilla](https://bugs.linaro.org/buglist.cgi?bug_status=__open__&list_id=17922&order=Importance&product=Kernel%20Functional%20Testing&query_format=specific).
All bugzilla bugs are regularly reviewed, investigated, and reported internally
or upstream.

All regressions are triaged and reported internally and/or upstream. Typically
the test will also be added as a known issue until it is fixed.

# Running Test Suites

## Linux Test Project (LTP)

The following test sets are run in
[LTP](https://github.com/linux-test-project/ltp):

- cap_bounds
- commands
- containers
- controllers
- crypto
- cve
- dio
- fcntl-locktests
- filecaps
- fs_bind
- fs_perms_simple
- fs
- hugetlb
- io
- ipc
- math
- mm
- nptl
- pty
- sched
- securebits
- syscalls
- tracing

The version of LTP used is the most recent release, plus backports that fix
regressions, if any.

### LTP Issues

LTP issues are tracked in several places.

Bugs are tracked in bugzilla and can be seen at
[bugs.linaro.org](https://bugs.linaro.org/buglist.cgi?bug_status=UNCONFIRMED&bug_status=CONFIRMED&bug_status=IN_PROGRESS&component=Linux%20Test%20Project%20%28LTP%29&list_id=20398&product=Kernel%20Functional%20Testing&query_format=advanced&resolution=---)
(query for product 'Kernel Functional Testing' and component 'Linux Test
Project (LTP)').

A skipfile is maintained which contains a list of tests that are not suitable
to run for a variety of reasons. LKFT's LTP skipfile can be found in
[test-definitions
repository](https://git.linaro.org/qa/test-definitions.git/tree/automated/linux/ltp/skipfile-lkft.yaml).

Finally, known issues are used to annotate failures in
[qa-reports](https://qa-reports.linaro.org/lkft/), so that known failures show
up as 'xfail' (expected fail), instead of a failure. The known issues that LKFT
uses in LTP can be found at
[qa-reports-known-issues](https://github.com/Linaro/qa-reports-known-issues/blob/master/ltp-production.yaml).

## Linux Kernel Selftests

Linux Kernel Selftests, or
[kselftests](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/kselftest.txt), are tests
that are included in the linux kernel tree under tools/testing/selftests/.

The version used depends on the kernel version under test:

- linux-next uses selftest included in linux-next
- mainline uses selftest included in mainline
- Latest stable uses selftest included in latest stable
- _All other LTS branches also use the version from latest stable_

Running a mismatched kselftest version does create false positives from time to
time, but it is the best balance between a supported and up to date set of
tests and an older kernel.

### Kselftest Issues

Kselftest issues are tracked in several places.

Bugs are tracked in bugzilla and can be seen at
[bugs.linaro.org](https://bugs.linaro.org/buglist.cgi?bug_status=UNCONFIRMED&bug_status=CONFIRMED&bug_status=IN_PROGRESS&component=kselftest&list_id=20399&product=Kernel%20Functional%20Testing&query_format=advanced&resolution=---)
(query for product 'Kernel Functional Testing' and component 'kselftest').

A skipfile is maintained which contains a list of tests that are not suitable to run for a variety of reasons. LKFT's Kselftest skipfile can be found in [test-definitions repository](https://git.linaro.org/qa/test-definitions.git/tree/automated/linux/kselftest/skipfile-lkft.yaml).

Finally, known issues are used to annotate failures in
[qa-reports](https://qa-reports.linaro.org/lkft/), so that known failures show

## Perf

Linux [perf](https://perf.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page) is built and
tested using a basic set of tests implemented at
[test-definitions](https://github.com/Linaro/test-definitions/tree/master/automated/linux/perf).

### LKFT Integration with Perf testing on Arm64

#### Build Kernel with extra debug configurations

Except the default config, we need to enable extra Linux kernel
configurations for building kernel image. Below is some missed
configurations that we can enable with the commands:

```shell
  export ARCH=arm64
  export CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu-
  cd $LINUX_SRC
  make defconfig
  ./scripts/config -e CONFIG_BPF_SYSCALL
  ./scripts/config -e CONFIG_BPF_JIT_ALWAYS_ON
  ./scripts/config -e CONFIG_TRACEPOINTS
  ./scripts/config -e CONFIG_KPROBES
  ./scripts/config -e CONFIG_UPROBES
  ./scripts/config -e CONFIG_KRETPROBES
  ./scripts/config -e CONFIG_PROC_KCORE
  ./scripts/config -e CONFIG_NOP_TRACER
  ./scripts/config -e CONFIG_TRACER_MAX_TRACE
  ./scripts/config -e CONFIG_RING_BUFFER
  ./scripts/config -e CONFIG_EVENT_TRACING
  ./scripts/config -e CONFIG_CONTEXT_SWITCH_TRACER
  ./scripts/config -e CONFIG_TRACING
  ./scripts/config -e CONFIG_GENERIC_TRACER
  ./scripts/config -e CONFIG_FTRACE
  ./scripts/config -e CONFIG_FUNCTION_TRACER
  ./scripts/config -e CONFIG_FUNCTION_GRAPH_TRACER
  ./scripts/config -e CONFIG_SCHED_TRACER
  ./scripts/config -e CONFIG_FTRACE_SYSCALLS
  ./scripts/config -e CONFIG_TRACER_SNAPSHOT
  ./scripts/config -e CONFIG_KPROBE_EVENTS
  ./scripts/config -e CONFIG_UPROBE_EVENTS
  ./scripts/config -e CONFIG_BPF_EVENTS
  ./scripts/config -e CONFIG_DYNAMIC_EVENTS
  ./scripts/config -e CONFIG_PROBE_EVENTS
  ./scripts/config -e CONFIG_DYNAMIC_FTRACE
  yes "" | make oldconfig
```

#### Installation dependency libs on target board

```shell
# apt-get install flex bison libelf-dev libaudit-dev libdw-dev libunwind* python-dev binutils-dev \
  libnuma-dev libbfd-dev libelf1 libperl-dev libslang2 libslang2-dev libunwind8 libunwind8-dev \
  binutils-multiarch-dev elfutils libiberty-dev libncurses5-dev
# apt-get install clang-7 llvm-7
```

#### The kernel source code path

The kernel source code is fatal for 'perf probe' related testings;
usually, on Arm platform the perf probe related testings fail due to
perf tool cannot find the kernel source code path.

On x86 platform, it's quite common to use the same PC to build kernel
and perf tool, and then can directly run the perf test on it. Thus it's
smooth for x86 to allow debugging tools to find the source code path
based on vmlinux's dwarf info.

On the other hand, Arm platforms, usually, we cross compile kernel image
on our PC or laptop and then run the testing on Arm boards. So the
issue is perf tool uses the vmlinux's dwarf info to find the source code
path but the path is PC's path but not the kernel source code path on
the target board.

To fix this issue, the simple method is to create the same path on Arm
platforms with the PC; for example, on the PC side, build the kernel
in the folder "/home/leoy/Work/opensource/linux-cs-dev"; then on Arm
board, should create the path "/home/leoy/Work/opensource/linux-cs-dev"
and mount NFS on this folder. Thus the Arm board can use the same code
base and this allows perf tool to easily to find kernel source code.

#### Exporting perf python lib

Perf provides python's .so, which needs to tell python the right path to
export 'perf' class. This can be finished with below command:

```shell
export PYTHONPATH=/home/leoy/Work/opensource/linux-cs-dev/tools/perf/python/
```

#### Perf config file

We need to configure clang related options thus allows perf tool to have
knowledge for clang and llvm:

```shell
# cd $LINUX_SRC
# ./tools/perf/perf config llvm.clang-path=clang-7
# ./tools/perf/perf config llvm.kbuild-dir=/home/leoy/Work/opensource/linux-cs-dev/
# ./tools/perf/perf config llvm.clang-opt="-g"
```

#### Testing result

```shell
# cd $LINUX_SRC
# ./tools/perf/perf test
```

## Video4Linux (v4l2)

The [v4l2-compliance tests](https://linuxtv.org/wiki/index.php/V4L_Test_Suite)
are run using a virtual driver (VIVI)

## KVM Unit Tests

[KVM-unit-tests](https://www.linux-kvm.org/page/KVM-unit-tests) are run to
verify basic functionality of KVM.

## S Suite

[S I/O Benchmark Suite](https://github.com/Algodev-github/S) are enabled for a
subset of systems to verify I/O performance.

For the moment, this test makes it possible to execute the following
two benchmarks with the suite:

- responsiveness, by measuring start-up times of real applications
  under real background workloads;
- throughput with processes doing filesystem or raw I/O in parallel
  (figure of merit measured by many other suites too).

## KUnit

Separate test runs of
[KUnit](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/dev-tools/kunit/index.html) are
enabled for Qemu on x86 (64/32 bits) and arm (64/32 bits).

# Future Test Suites

We are continuously evaluating test suites for use in LKFT. We are guided by
feedback from kernel engineers and the community at large. If you would like to
see a particular test or test suite added to LKFT, please [contact us](mailto:
lkft@linaro.org).
